# BED Final Project Starter

Final project - Back-end development at Winc Academy

For this assignment we had to develop the back-end for a booking app. 

For this project I used:

Express.js to model the RESTful API including
- route handling for all the CRUD operations
- authentication with JSON Web Token
- error handling mostly within the app, and unhandled errors via Sentry
- logging with Winston 
  
Prisma to model the database and seed the database with the provided data from the assignment.
